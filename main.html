	<br>
	<p>Panaji is the capital of the Indian state of <b>Goa</b> and the headquarters of <b>North Goa district</b>. Previously, it was the territorial capital of the former Portuguese India. It lies on the banks of the Mandovi river estuary in the Tiswadi sub-district (taluka). With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panaji is Goa's largest urban agglomeration, ahead of Margao and Mormugao.

Panaji has <i>terraced hills</i>, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with gulmohar, acacia and other trees. The baroque Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church is located overlooking the main square known as <i>Pra√ßa da Igreja</i>. Panaji has been selected as one of hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission.

The city was built with stepped streets and a <b>seven kilometre</b> long promenade on a planned grid system after the Portuguese relocated the capital from Velha Goa in the <b>17th century</b>. It was elevated from a town to a city on <i>22 March 1843</i>.</p>
